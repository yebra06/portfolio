# Portfolio

## Tools
* [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html) - For rendering
* [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) - To bundle my portfolio
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) - For managing dependencies

## Setup
After one has cloned and navigated to repo:

```bash
yarn install
```

## Run server

```bash
yarn start
```

> Now, checkout my work here -> http://localhost:3001/
>> **Please Note** - I am currently still building, so you may see an app in construction. But stay tuned!
